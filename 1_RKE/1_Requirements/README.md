## ABSTRACT  
### An Automobile or Car is a land vehicle used to carry passengers. Automobiles usually have four wheels, and an engine or motor to make them move. Remote keyless entry (RKE) system is a system designed to remotely lock or unlock access to automobiles. Security is more important in automobiles as they are costly to buy. Costly cars had more features than normal cars. In this project we are going to lock or unlock the automobiles using remote.

## IDENTIFYING FEATURES
###	* STM32F407VG controller shall be used for the control of the system.
###	* LCD Display shall be provided to display operations.
### * This system provides easy security access to the automobiles.
### * The remote shall send and receive radio signals with particular frequency.
### * The automobile owners shall get benefited.

## STATE OF ART
### RKE transmission requires two components - a transmitter and a receiver. 
### * Transmitter - RKE key fob, other ID device with RKE integrated 
### * Receiver - Body Control ECU, other ECU with integrated RKE 
### RKE operates by broadcasting radio waves on a particular frequency unidirectionally. RKE systems implement encryption and rolling code algorithms to prevent car thieves from intercepting and spoofing the telegrams.

## REQUIREMENTS

### High Level Requirements
| ID | High Level Requirements |
| :---: | :---: |
| HLR1 | System shall control automobile lock or unlock |
| HLR2 | There shall be an LCD to display some contents |
| HLR3 | Remote shall be used to control the automobile |
| HLR4 | System Shall capture frequency |

### Low Level Requirements
| ID | Low Level Requirements for HLR1 | ID	| Low Level Requirements for HLR2 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| LLR1.1 |	According to signal frequency, lock system shall be controlled | LLR2.1 |	Lock & Unlock status shall be displayed |
| LLR1.2  |	The system shall be control by remote |	LLR2.2 |	Alarm activation/deactivation & approach light  status shall be displayed |
| ID |	Low Level Requirements for HLR3 |	ID | Low Level Requirements for HLR4 |
| LLR3.1 | Lock & Unlock shall be controlled|	LLR4.1 | Remote shall send the signal to automobile with particular frequency |
| LLR3.2 | Alarm activation/deactivation & approach light shall be controlled |	LLR4.2 |  Remote shall capture the signal to automobile with particular frequency |

## ADVANTAGES
###	* Easy to use.
###	* It helps to protect automobile from thieves.
###	* During night it is very easy to find automobile if more cars are present.

## DISADVANTAGES
###	* If any other remote have our remote frequency then our automobile security is in trouble.
###	* If our remote is lost then our automobile security is in more trouble.
