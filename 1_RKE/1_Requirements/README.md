## ABSTRACT  
### An Automobile or Car is a land vehicle used to carry passengers. Automobiles usually have four wheels, and an engine or motor to make them move. Remote keyless entry (RKE) system is a system designed to remotely lock or unlock access to automobiles. Security is more important in automobiles as they are costly to buy. Costly cars had more features than normal cars. In this project we are going to lock or unlock the automobiles using remote.

## IDENTIFYING FEATURES
###	* STM32F407VG controller shall be used for the control of the system.
###	* LCD Display shall be provided to display operations.
### * This system provides easy security access to the automobiles.
### * The remote shall send and receive radio signals with particular frequency.
### * The automobile owners shall get benefited.

## STATE OF ART
### RKE transmission requires two components - a transmitter and a receiver. 
### * Transmitter - RKE key fob, other ID device with RKE integrated 
### * Receiver - Body Control ECU, other ECU with integrated RKE 
### RKE operates by broadcasting radio waves on a particular frequency unidirectionally. RKE systems implement encryption and rolling code algorithms to prevent car thieves from intercepting and spoofing the telegrams.
