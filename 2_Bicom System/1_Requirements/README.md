# RKE BI-DIRECTIONAL COMMUNICATION SYSTEM
## Description
  The focus of this project is remotely knowing the status of automobiles in Bi-Directional Communication RKE method which works as same as Unidirectional RKE System with a key which is capable of two way communication with the car is the extension here. Its communication interface is better than Unidirectional way.
## Research:
 ### State of art
 * By using this advanced modern technologies we are remotely monitoring the status of Car.
 * The transmissions between the car and key are encrypted to prevent theft.
 * Notify you that the command by the user using key fob has been executed in the Bi-Com system which has more securable than Unidirectional RKE System.
## Cost
   Comparing with the Unidirectioanl RKE System its Cost High which includes two features in one product.
## Features
 * To print **Window** status of the car as a result all LED on at the same time
 * To print **Alarm** status as a result all LED off at the same time
 * To print **Car battery information** as a result all LED on in clockwise manner
 * To print **Door** status of the car as a result all LED on in anti-clockwise manner)
 
 Based on the press count of the switch (1-4) the above mentioned features are going to work accordingly .
 
## SWOT Anlaysis
## 5 W's & 1'H
## Detail Requirements
 ### High Level Requirements
 ### Low Level Requirements
## Advantages
* Convience, better security, automatic workcontrol.
* No need of human interaction with the car.
* This system provides easy security access to the automobiles through encryption.
* The automobile owners shall get benefited.
## Disadvantages
* Cost more than a traditional key to replace the lost key fob and leads security problem for car when key fob gets lost.
* This system works on certain limited range.
