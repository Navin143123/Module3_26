# RKE BI-DIRECTIONAL COMMUNICATION SYSTEM
## Description
  The focus of this project is remotely knowing the status of automobiles in Bi-Directional Communication RKE method which works as same as Unidirectional RKE System with a key which is capable of two way communication with the car is the extension here. Its communication interface is better than Unidirectional way.
## Research:
 ### State of art
 * By using this advanced modern technologies we are remotely monitoring the status of Car.
 * The transmissions between the car and key are encrypted to prevent theft.
 * Notify you that the command by the user using key fob has been executed in the Bi-Com system which has more securable than Unidirectional RKE System.
## Cost
   Comparing with the Unidirectioanl RKE System its Cost High which includes two features in one product.
## Features
 * To print **Window** status of the car as a result all LED on at the same time
 * To print **Alarm** status as a result all LED off at the same time
 * To print **Car battery information** as a result all LED on in clockwise manner
 * To print **Door** status of the car as a result all LED on in anti-clockwise manner)
 
 Based on the press count of the switch (1-4) the above mentioned features are going to work accordingly .
## 5 W's & 1'H
## SWOT Anlaysis
## Detail Requirements
 ### High Level Requirements
| ID | High Level Requirements |
| :---: | :---: |
| HLR1 | System shall be able to print **Window status** of automobile |
| HLR2 | System shall be able to print **Alarm status** of automobile |
| HLR3 | System shall be able to print **Car Battery information** |
| HLR4 | System Shall be able to print **Door status** of the automobile |

### Low Level Requirements
| ID | Low Level Requirements for HLR1 | ID	| Low Level Requirements for HLR2 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| LLR1.1 |	According to signal frequency, lock system shall be controlled | LLR2.1 |	Lock & Unlock status shall be displayed |
| LLR1.2  |	The system shall be control by remote |	LLR2.2 |	Alarm activation/deactivation & approach light  status shall be displayed |
| **ID** |	**Low Level Requirements for HLR3** |	**ID** | **Low Level Requirements for HLR4** |
| LLR3.1 | Lock & Unlock shall be controlled|	LLR4.1 | Remote shall send the signal to automobile with particular frequency |
| LLR3.2 | Alarm activation/deactivation & approach light shall be controlled |	LLR4.2 |  Remote shall uses encryption ,eg(1+2 is sended, 3 should be received |

## Advantages
* Convience, better security, automatic workcontrol.
* No need of human interaction with the car.
* This system provides easy security access to the automobiles through encryption.
* The automobile owners shall get benefited.
## Disadvantages
* If remote is lost then automobile security is in more trouble.
* If any other remote have our remote frequency then our automobile security is in trouble.
* This system works on certain limited range.
